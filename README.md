# Getting Started with React 

## Objectives of this project:
```
* Investigate how to consume an API with React.
* See different ways to use CSS and components
* To continue learning about the React CLI framework.
```

## Results:
```
* The API consumption is not that different from Vue.js.
* Style-components is horrible (I have to find out if I use it in the most optimal way)
* Keep improving the component creation in React (I find it very different from Vue.js CLI )
```

## Tools:
```
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript
* React.js
* Axios
* Style-components (I don't like this one, I need to find another way to use CSS)
* Material-ui
```
